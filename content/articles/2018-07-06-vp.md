Discussion of the VP titles.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

> Even so, chiefs are relatively rare compared with presidents and their various declensions (vice-, assistant-, etc). Almost everybody in banking from the receptionist upwards is a president of some sort...The essence of inflation, after all, is that it devalues everything that it touches.[^economist].

> In brokerage firms, investment banks and other financial companies, "vice president" is a seniority rank rather than denoting an actual managerial position within the company. It is a relatively junior position, usually does not denote managerial responsibilities and companies have a large number of vice presidents,[7] perhaps as an inexpensive way for a company to recognize employees, or perhaps because of delayering when an employee can't be moved higher in the organization but still deserves recognition.[8] In most cases, the title merely implies that someone is in a medium-seniority individual contributor role.[^wikipedia]

> While the hierarchy at other banks goes something like analyst, associate, vice president (VP) and managing director (MD), the hierarchy at Barclays goes more like analyst, AVP, VP, director and then MD[^barclays].
