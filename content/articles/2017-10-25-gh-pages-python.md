Building a basic website is an important skill for the entrepreneur, employee, and citizen of the internet. My goal is that after reading this post you will:

1. Agree that controlling your web domain has benefits, and that basic web design skills can aid in this.
2. Understand the basic concepts required to build and operate a website, regardless of technology choices.
3. Be able to build your own simple static website by following my detailed instructions which use a set of popular (and free) technologies. 

The sections below are aligned with these goals. Let's get started.

# Part I: Why Your Domain Matters
The web, as envisioned by its inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee, exists to enable "human communication, commerce, and opportunities to share knowledge."[^vision]
[^vision] [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Mission](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission#vision)

The emergence of major web companies that control content creation—Facebook, etc.—endanger some of this vision by:

- pragmatic
- allows you to own your platform and message
- contributes to a healthy internet (control personal data and information spread; not [too] relient on the corporations that own the internet)
- take responsibility for what we say
- helps you understand how the internet really works and impacts your life

> I think every young person who regularly uses a computer should learn the following:
> 
> 1. how to choose a domain name<br>
> 2. how to buy a domain<br>
> 3. how to choose a good domain name provider<br>
> 4. how to choose a good website-hosting service<br>
> 5. how to find a good free text editor<br>
> 6. how to transfer files to and from a server<br>
> 7. how to write basic HTML, including links to CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) files<br>
> 8. how to find free CSS templates<br>
> 9. how to fiddle around in those templates to adjust them to your satisfaction<br>
> 10. how to do basic photograph editing<br>
> 11. how to cite your sources and link to the originals<br>
> 12. how to use social media to share what you’ve created on your own turf rather than create within a walled factory<br>
> 
> One could add considerably to this list, but these, I believe, are the rudimentary skills that should be possessed by anyone who wants to be a responsible citizen of the open Web—and not to be confined to living on the bounty of the digital headmasters.
