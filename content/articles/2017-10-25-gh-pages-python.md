Building a basic website is an important skill for the entrepreneur, employee, and citizen of the Internet. My goal is that after reading this post you will:

1. Agree that controlling your web domain has benefits, and that basic web design skills can aid in this.
2. Understand the basic concepts required to build and operate a website, regardless of technology choices.
3. Be able to build your own simple static website by following my detailed instructions which use a set of popular (and free) technologies. 

The sections below are aligned with these three goals. Let's get started.

# Part I: Why to Share on the Internet (from your own domain)

## Why to Share on the Internet

### Benefits to You
- **Learning**: sharing publicly forces you to learn
  - "teaching is the best way to learn": on the Internet your students are anyone who finds what you share to be useful or interesting (as well as your future self)
  - publich sharing/teaching forces you to refine your thinking so as to not embarass yourself. This post, for instance, started as a simple gh-pages tutorial but caused me to think deeply about the purpose of the Internet.
- **Feedback**: 
  - "you are who you spend your time with" and you need to challenge yourself by people better than yourself: even if physically isolated the Internet provides ready access to the people you want in your life
- **Body of Work**: practical and satisfaction
  - it gives you a public body of work to point to
  - yes there are practical benefits, but those are not the focus: job, portfolio, connections, etc.
  - more important is the learning in yourself and the satisfaction you receive from distilling some knowledge or wisdom
- **Offload and record your thoughts**:
  - doesn't need to be public, but doing the above publicly serves this end
  - notes to your future self (useful and ...)
  - serves as a journal of your intellectual development
- **Business**:
  - if you are an entrepreneur, you need to reach customers
  - helps you network, etc.

### Benefits to Others
- **Share info**: 
  - image of "on your computer" vs. "on the Internet"
  - David Robinson "why you should blog"
  - think of all that you've learned from blogs, etc.
  - feeling of just discovering someone and being nourished by their thinking: recently JMW, AJ, MMM
  - contributes to the original vision of the Internet
- **Domocracy in the public square**: need to have a voice in the public square
  - builds a strong democracy: for our democracy to be healthy we need a serious conversation in the public square - the Internet is a public square
  - FT, etc.
  - Toqueville...?
  - Helpful: In a remarkable essay titled “On Leisure,” published after Seneca retired, the philosopher wrote in an oblique way about his own experiences: “The duty of a man is to be useful to his fellow-men; if possible, to be useful to many of them; failing this, to be useful to a few; failing this, to be useful to his neighbors, and, failing them, to himself: for when he helps others, he advances the general interests of mankind.”






## Why You Should Share From Your Own Domain
- **Control Your Data**:
- **Control Your Message**:
- **Better Understand the Internet**:
- **Support the good parts of the Internet, not the bad**:
  - does not support corporations that want to own your attention and sell your data
  - does not support a culture of anonymous sharing that leads to misinformation and ad homenin





The web, as envisioned by its inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee, exists to enable "human communication, commerce, and opportunities to share knowledge."[^vision]
[^vision] [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Mission](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission#vision)

The emergence of major web companies that control content creation—Facebook, etc.—endanger some of this vision by:

- pragmatic
- allows you to own your platform and message
- contributes to a healthy Internet (control personal data and information spread; not [too] relient on the corporations that own the Internet)
- take responsibility for what we say
- helps you understand how the Internet really works and impacts your life

> I think every young person who regularly uses a computer should learn the following:
> 
> 1. how to choose a domain name<br>
> 2. how to buy a domain<br>
> 3. how to choose a good domain name provider<br>
> 4. how to choose a good website-hosting service<br>
> 5. how to find a good free text editor<br>
> 6. how to transfer files to and from a server<br>
> 7. how to write basic HTML, including links to CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) files<br>
> 8. how to find free CSS templates<br>
> 9. how to fiddle around in those templates to adjust them to your satisfaction<br>
> 10. how to do basic photograph editing<br>
> 11. how to cite your sources and link to the originals<br>
> 12. how to use social media to share what you’ve created on your own turf rather than create within a walled factory<br>
> 
> One could add considerably to this list, but these, I believe, are the rudimentary skills that should be possessed by anyone who wants to be a responsible citizen of the open Web—and not to be confined to living on the bounty of the digital headmasters.
