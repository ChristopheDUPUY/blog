Some principles to live by:

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->


Start and end every day in prayer to God: praising him, asking him for grace and sustenance and thanking him for all that you have. 

Read: for fun as well as to learn

Appreciate beauty, art

Something from Churchill: "Live well but do not flaunt it" (591)

Boredom, time to think

Exercise, walks

Be a "good second rate person"?

Work with your hands

Let your work be cumulative: produce something that grows with time (both work and savings)

"You learn something new every day" (Island of the World)

Time with nature 

Driving: minimize acceleration (to save gas, be less stressed, be safer, reduce traffic jams, reduce wear and tear on your car...)

Find humor, especially in tension or challenge 

Find a form of physical exercise you genuinely enjoy. 

Do yard work 

Be grateful and compare yourself to others who have it worse. You will be a lot happier and less stressed. 

Live simply. Live below your means. Drive an old car and live in a small house. Save money. 

Say no to things that do activities, people, and belongings that drain you and donâ€™t add value to your life. But remember that the only way to keep something is to give it away. 

Thank other people. Tell them thank you. Write them a thank you note and send it in the mail.
